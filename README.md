# Converter
This is a Symfony 4 project for my job application at Inventis.

## Run the project 
I have added the build folder to my repo, so that you can easily run the project
with only these 2 commands:

`composer install` to install the dependencies.

`php bin/console server:run` to run the Symfony server.

###Modify assets:

`yarn watch` to enable file watching

`yarn prod` to minify your files for production
